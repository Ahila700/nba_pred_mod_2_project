My project is to analyze nba statistics from the last 6 seasons. I took box score stats as well as some of the advanced statistics that didnt directly lead to winning to try and find the stats that would most lead to wins

Gathering NBA data - 
  used basketball reference to gather data from 180 teams and 2700+ players
  Mainly used standard box score stats such as points, rebounds and assists as well as some advanced stats
  
Cleaning NBA data - 
  organized all the data by team and year to combined at the end
  changed all strings to ints/floats
  removed all duplicates since it had players from multiple teams as well as their totals
  
EDA Analysis - 
  created scatter plots for all features against the wins
  generated heat maps for correlation to find high correlation and collinearity
  
modeling_data_practice - 
  created baseline models as well as all following models removing features as i went along
  
final_models -
  created final model using lasso method and the best features from the last modeling practice
  
Test for interactions -
  added interactions and polynomials to test for better features
  
CSV files -
  all csv files used and created in the project

Photos - 
  all graphs used in the presentation
